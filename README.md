# Hello!

This project was created exclusively just for fun. If you have color blind friends (red-green) and want to give them a funny picture T-shirt, create an SVG template in two clicks.

**[TRY IT OUT](https://lunarlynx.github.io/color-blind-joke/)**

#### Example of the generated image (you may try unicode):
![Example blind](md/blind.png)

#### In case if you don't see the symbol, it is the unblind version:
![Example unblind](md/unblind.png)

download template in:
#### svg
#### png

### Warning!
Your color blind friends are unlikely to appreciate this joke.
